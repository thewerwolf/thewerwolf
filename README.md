# Hi there, I'm [Your Name] ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm a passionate learner and problem solver with a background in hobbyist electrical and mechanical engineering. I'm transitioning into coding, although I'm already familiar with programming concepts through my experience with tools like LabVIEW and other similar environments. Now, I'm excited to dive deeper into the world of coding and expand my skills.

## Project Overview

In my current project, I'm learning to utilize a range of powerful tools and technologies to extract data from websites and make informed money-related decisions. Some of the key tools I'm exploring include:

- **Scrapy:** Web scraping framework for extracting data from websites.
- **SQLite:** Lightweight database system for storing scraped data.
- **NLTK and spaCy:** Natural Language Processing libraries for analyzing textual data.
- **scikit-learn:** Machine learning library for making predictions and recommendations.
- **Seaborn:** Visualization library for creating insightful data visualizations.

## Seeking Guidance and Mentorship

As someone who is accustomed to programming but relatively new to coding, I'm constantly seeking guidance and mentorship to bridge the gap between the two. If you have experience in transitioning from programming to coding or any insights to share, I would greatly appreciate your support and advice as I navigate this exciting journey.

## Visual and User-Friendly Designs

Creating visual and user-friendly designs is of utmost importance to me. I believe that presenting information in an accessible and intuitive manner is key to effective communication. That's why I've chosen VS Code as my preferred IDE, as it helps me streamline my development process while ensuring visually appealing outcomes.

Let's connect and collaborate to turn our ideas into elegant solutions!
